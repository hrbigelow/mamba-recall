# Experiments with Mamba State Space Models

Experiments with the Mamba model from [Dau and
Gu](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00752.pdf) using their
[implementation](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba)

First experiment is to train on the synthetic data induction heads task, and
visualize the $\Delta(u_l)$ values in both layers.
